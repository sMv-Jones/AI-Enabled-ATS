# 🚀 AI Resume Matcher

An intelligent, context-aware resume screening platform built with the **MERN stack**. The application uses **Azure AI Document Intelligence** for accurate resume parsing, **Vector Cosine Similarity** for semantic matching, and **Google Gemini AI** for advanced candidate analysis and skill-gap detection.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Context-Aware Resume Matching

Matches candidates based on semantic understanding rather than simple keyword matching.

**Example:** A candidate with **React.js** experience can still align strongly with a **MERN Stack** requirement.

### 📊 Intelligent Candidate Scoring

Ranks resumes using vector-based similarity scoring to identify the most relevant candidates.

### 💡 Skill Gap Analysis

Highlights missing skills, tools, technologies, and keywords required for a specific role.

### 🔍 Resume Quality Insights

Provides detailed feedback on:

* Resume strengths
* Areas for improvement
* Content quality
* Formatting issues

### 📄 AI-Powered Resume Parsing

Extracts structured information from PDF and DOCX resumes using Azure AI Document Intelligence.
